- Wedding gallery / album management
- Supabase-backed CMS content

## Architecture

- `index.html` — public wedding site
- `app.js` — RSVP, gallery and public page behavior
- `personalized.js` — personalized invite loading, prefill, welcome and open tracking
- `invitation.js` — invitation-cover opening flow
- `particles.js` — global wedding particle system
- `motion.js` — page motion effects
- `music.js` — wedding music controls
- `admin/` — authenticated wedding CMS
- `supabase.sql` — reference schema/policies/functions
- `docs/` — technical documentation and project memo

## RSVP model

There are three response sources:

- `invite` — submitted from a personalized invitation link
- `public` — submitted from the normal public website
- `admin` — reserved for records created/managed by admin workflows

Personalized RSVP records are uniquely linked by `invite_id`. Re-submitting the same invitation updates the same RSVP row instead of creating duplicates.

## Local development

Serve the repository with any static HTTP server. Opening `index.html` directly may work for simple UI checks, but a local server is recommended for routing and asset behavior.

## Supabase

Configuration is stored in `config.js`.

The production project currently uses the schema documented in `supabase.sql`. Database changes should be applied through migrations, not by editing production data manually.

## Deployment

The repository is connected to Vercel. Pushes to `main` trigger a production deployment automatically.

## Romantic Collage invitation

- The interior invitation includes five optional photo interludes after Story, Countdown, Events, Gallery and RSVP.
- By default, up to seven already-published homepage photos appear in a curated Romantic Collage arrangement; the layout remains empty if no images exist.
- Admin → **Collage thiệp** uses published Album images and saves the ordered layout as JSON to `site_content` with key `collage_layout` (no database migration).
- Admin supports Polaroid, film-frame, full-width, caption in VI/EN/JA, hide/show, reorder (drag or buttons), edit, remove and explicit Publish.
- Album uploads, storage, guest invites and RSVP behavior remain unchanged. Only already-published gallery images render publicly.
- To intentionally hide all collage photos, remove the entries and Publish an empty list. To add new photos, upload and Publish them in Admin → Album first.
